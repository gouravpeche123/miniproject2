Employee-management-system
#Description : The project name is "Employee Management System" and it is built using the ASP.NET MVC core and Entity Framework. It implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database to manage Employee information.

#Approach: The project is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application's concerns into three main components: the model, which represents the data and business logic; the view, which represents the user interface; and the controller, which handles user input and manages communication between the model and view. The Entity Framework is used to interact with the student database. This makes it easier to perform CRUD operations on the database without writing SQL queries directly.

#Features ##Home page : The home page of the application displays a list of all the Employees in the database, along with options to create, edit, and delete students.

##Create page : The create page allows maneger to add a new Employee to the database. maneger can enter the Employee's name, Employee's City, and Employee's address. ##Edit page : The edit page allows manager to update an existing Employee's information. Manager can edit the Employee's name, Employee's Email, and Employee's salary. ##Delete functionality: The delete functionality allows users to remove a Employee from the database.

##Details functionality: The details functionality allows users to display for a specific Employee details in the database by name.
